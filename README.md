## Informations

The TMDBViewer app was created with the Clean Swift architecture because it's a type of architecture that is emerging and has been shown to be effective when it comes to scalability and organization. It's little more verbose than other types of architecture but when you are usually with it helps you to see easily where the things are (view, service call, business logic, etc)
